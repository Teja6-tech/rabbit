<p>
1. A baby <b>rabbit</b> is called a <b>kit</b>, a female is called a <b>doe</b> and a male is called a <b>buck</b>.<br>

2. Rabbits are very social creatures that live in groups. They live in warrens — a series of tunnels and rooms that they dig underground.

3. A rabbit’s teeth never stop growing! Instead, they’re gradually worn down as the rabbit chews on grasses, wildflowers and vegetables — meaning they never get too long.<br>

4. Rabbits perform an athletic leap, known as a ‘binky‘, when they’re happy — performing twists and kicks in mid air!<br>

5. Rabbits’ eyes are on the sides of their head, meaning they can see almost all the way around them. This helps them to keep a close watch for predators while they’re going about their business!<br>
